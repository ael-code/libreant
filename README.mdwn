LibreAnt
========

This is libreant: a software to manage both your ebooks and your physical books.
Its approach is:
* minimum assumptions about your library structure, catalogation systems or
  whatsoever
* ease of deployment
* ease to build a decentralized network for integration, sharing, and search

Its main UI is a web one

Quick start
-----------

First of all, make sure you have elasticsearch and python2 and virtualenv2 on your computer.
On archlinux, this is `pacman -S elasticsearch python2 python2-virtualenv`
Then, run

```sh
virtualenv2 --no-site-packages ve
./ve/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now your environment is ready and you can run `./run_all_dev.sh ve`

Implementation
==============

Main building blocks are python, elasticsearch, flask.

Testing
=======

There is not much, still. However, after having activated your virtualenv, start
elasticsearch, running `./run_es.sh -d`

Now you can run the unit test, using `nosetests -c nose.cfg`

For a more complete testing, wait a bit longer ;)
